# Hello, GitHub!

While still in high school, I started working on various FiveM servers - many of which were a massive success and made my team the most renowned in the Polish FiveM community. I also helped people with their websites - providing them with payment methods and authorization systems. My biggest project in 2024 was a very sophisticated GUI for FiveM (user dashboard, finance management, organization management system, user-driven marketplace, NFS-like vehicle system). My other projects include a Warcraft 2 web port built with NextJS (WIP) and a user-friendly marketplace designed for game server owners (WIP).
