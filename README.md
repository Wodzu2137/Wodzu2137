# Good Morning, GitHub!

First of all - let me introduce myself. My name is Igor, but most people call me “Warchief” for dumb reasons. **Web Dev**, especially **JS, ReactJS**, and **NodeJS** are things that I’m the most passionate about. On the other hand, working with **Flutter**, **Android Studio**, and **C++** is not much of a deal either.

# Experience

1.  **Internships**

	-   One month working for a computer shop and service
	-   One month working for a web dev company
	-   Two weeks working for a German IT company as a part of the Erasmus+ program

1.  **Cooperation**

	-   Lead front-end and web developer for top Polish FiveM servers
	-   Working with renowned Polish company Tangiriboat on their new project MGM Trailers as the head web developer

1.  **Custom free time projects and plans for the future**

	-   Currently working on a web rework of the 1995 game “Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness” by Blizzard Entertainment
	-   Establishing Web Dev Limited company with my project partner within two years (that’s why I’ve got no portfolio website - waiting until we manage to set it all up)
	-   Establishing Game Dev Limited company within two years, as I’ve gathered many talented people to get it started

## My interests

Since I can even remotely remember, computers are my hobby and passion, but that’s not everything. What I do during my free time could be concluded by the following:

Studying: history, societal problems, geopolitics, math, physics

Playing RTS video games

Reading books (I seriously recommend anything by Glukhovsky)

Playing Airsoft

Doing anything even remotely connected to the military or firearms in general
